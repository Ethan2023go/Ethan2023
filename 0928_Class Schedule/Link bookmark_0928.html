    The second 2024 Republican presidential primary debate ended just as it began: with former President Donald Trump – who hasn’t yet appeared alongside his rivals onstage – as the party’s dominant front-runner.
The seven GOP contenders in Wednesday night’s showdown at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California provided a handful of memorable moments, including former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley unloading what often seemed like the entire field’s pent-up frustration with entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.
“Honestly, every time I hear you, I feel a little bit dumber for what you say,” she said to him at one point.
All night, Scott seemed like he was looking for a fight with somebody and he finally got that when he set his sights on fellow South Carolinian Haley.

He began his line of attack – which Haley interjected with a “Bring it” – by accusing her of spending $50,000 on curtains in a $15 million subsidized location during her time as the US ambassador to the United Nations.

What ensued was the two Republicans going back and forth about the curtains. “Do your homework, Tim, because Obama bought those curtains,” Haley said, while Scott repeated, “Did you send them back? Did you send them back?” Haley then responded: “Did you send them back? You’re the one who works in Congress.”

It wasn’t the most acrimonious moment of the night, but it was up there. The feuding between the two South Carolina natives seemed deep, but it’s worth remembering that about a decade ago, when Haley was governor, she appointed Scott to the Senate seat he currently holds after Republican Jim DeMint stepped down. That confidence in Scott seems to have dissolved in this presidential race.

    The GOP field also took early shots at President Joe Biden. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott said Biden, rather than joining the striking auto workers’ union on the picket line Tuesday in Michigan, should be on the southern border. Former Vice President Mike Pence said Biden should be “on the unemployment line.” North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum said Biden was interfering with “free markets.”
However, what played out in the debate, hosted by Fox Business Network and Univision, is unlikely to change the trajectory of a GOP race in which Trump has remained dominant in national and early-state polling.
Ad Feedback And the frequently messy, hard-to-track crosstalk could have led many viewers to tune out entirely.
Here are takeaways from the second GOP primary debate:
Confronted by his Republican competitors for the first time in earnest, DeSantis delivered an uneven performance from the center of the stage – a spot that is considerably less secure than it was heading into the first debate in Milwaukee.

Despite rules that allowed candidates to respond if they were invoked, DeSantis let Fox slip to commercial break when Pence seemed to blame the governor for a jury decision to award a life sentence, not the death penalty, to the mass murderer in the Parkland high school shooting. (DeSantis opposed the decision and championed a law that made Florida the state with the lowest threshold to put someone on death row going forward.) Nor did he respond when Pence accused DeSantis of inflating Florida’s budget by 30% during his tenure.

He later let Scott get the last word on Florida’s Black history curriculum standards and struggled to defend himself when Haley – accurately – pointed out that he took steps to block fracking in Florida on his second day in office.

Before the first debate in Milwaukee, a top strategist for a pro-DeSantis super PAC told donors that “79% of the people tonight are going to watch the debate and turn it off after 19 minutes.”

    rump might have played it safe by skipping the debates and taking a running-as-an-incumbent a
    
    pproach to the 2024 GOP primary.
It’s hard to see, though, how he would pay a significant price in the eyes of the party’s voters 

for missing Wednesday night’s messy engagement.
Trump’s rivals took a few shots at him. DeSantis knocked him for deficit spending. Christie mocke

d him during the night’s early moments, calling him “Donald Duck” for skipping the debate and then in his final comments said he would vote Trump off the GOP island.
“This guy has not only divided our party – he’s divided families all over this country. He’s divi

ded friends all over this country,” Christie said. “He needs to be voted off the island and he needs to be taken out of this process.”
However, Trump largely escaped serious scrutiny of his four years in the Oval Office from a field

of rivals courting voters who have largely positive views of his presidency.
“Tonight’s GOP debate was as boring and inconsequential as the first debate, and nothing that was

said will change the dynamics of the primary contest,” Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita said in a statement.

    That’s tough for viewers trying to make sense of it all but even worse for the
    se candidates as 
    they attempted to stand out as viable alternatives to the absentee Trump.
Further complicating the matter, some of the highest polling candidates after Trum
p – DeSantis and 
Haley – were among those least willing to dive into the muck, especially during th
e crucial first h
our. The moderators repeatedly tried to clear the road for the Florida governor, 
at least in the beginning. But he was all but absent from the proceedings for the first 15 minutes.
Ramaswamy fared somewhat better, speaking louder – and faster – than most of his 
rivals. But he w
as bogged down repeatedly when caught between his own talking points and cross-vo
lleys of criticisms from frustrated candidates like Scott.
The moderator group will likely get criticism for losing control of the room with
in the first half-hour, but even a messy debate tells voters something about the people taking part.
y that measure, the Florida governor managed to first speak Wednesday night just in the nick of time – 16 minutes into the debate. And when he finally spoke, he continued the sharper attacks on the GOP front-runner that he has previewed in recent weeks.


DeSantis equated Trump’s absence in California to Biden, who DeSantis said was “c
ompletely missing in action for leadership” on the economy, blaming him for inflation and the autoworkers strike.

“And you know who else is missing in action? Donald Trump is missing in action,” 
DeSantis said. “He should be on this stage tonight. He owes it to you to defend his record.”

But DeSantis then largely pulled back from further targeting Trump – until a pos
t-debate Fox News appearance when he challenged the former president to a one-on-one face-off.

DeSantis ended the debate on a strong note. He took charge by rejecting moderato
r
 Dana Perino’s attempts to get the candidates to vote one of their competitors “off the island.” He ended his night forcefully dismissing a suggestion that Trump’s lead in the polls held meaning in September.
