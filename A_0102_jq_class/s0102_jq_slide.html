          South Korea's main opposition party leader Lee Jae-myung was stabbed in the neck during a visit to the southern city of Busan on           Tuesday in an assault that left him bloodied but conscious, party officials said.
          
          Lee was touring the construction site of the Gadeokdo New Airport and talking to reporters when he was attacked, leaving the           politician with a 1-centimeter laceration on the left side of his neck, Democratic Party spokesperson Kwon Chil-seung said.
          
          Lee suffered “suspected damage to his jugular vein” and doctors were concerned he may have additional bleeding, Kwon said, citing           doctors.
          
          “He will quickly undergo a surgery” at the Seoul National University Hospital, after having been transferred there from Busan,           the spokesperson said, describing the attempt on Lee's life an act of “terrorism” and “a serious threat to democracy.”.
